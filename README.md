# REFERAI
With a market exceeding $600 billion and more than 250 million active players, football engages over five billion fans worldwide, establishing itself as the king of sports globally and one of the largest entertainment industries.

With the widespread implementation of the VAR system, several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in improving refereeing accuracy. Spitz et al. (2021) analyzed 2,195 matches across 12 countries and concluded that, thanks to VAR, the accuracy rate of refereeing decisions increased from 92.1% to 98.3%. Moreover, during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the FIFA president reported that VAR conducted over 440 reviews, of which 16 decisions were corrected, improving referee accuracy by 4.32%, reaching 99.32%.

However, implementing this technology is unfeasible for most leagues: VAR can cost Â£9,251 plus VAT per match for lower-tier clubs, and the acquisition and operation of a single system can range from $150,000 to $200,000, with an annual cost of up to $6.5 million per season.

Referai offers a real, effective, and affordable solution for these leagues. This tool processes and analyzes video sequences from multiple cameras, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and LSTMs to extract spatial and temporal features. It has been trained on over 4,000 incidents labeled by experts and achieves 95% accuracy, raising the foul detection rate of an average referee up to 98%, approaching VAR standards.

By integrating as a live assistant, this solution democratizes access to referee support technology in leagues and countries with limited resources, reducing errors, unifying decision-making criteria, preserving game flow, and strengthening trust among all football stakeholders.
